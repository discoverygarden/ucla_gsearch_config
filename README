Indexing configuration for GSearch

This repo will holds a basic solr config, schema and xslt to use as a starting point for future projects.
It requires the joda library deployed to gsearch's lib directory
http://sourceforge.net/projects/joda-time/files/joda-time/

-- Installation --

This repo should be cloned such that the subfolder "gsearch_solr" ends up in
the GSearch "index" directory... So
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/fedoragsearch/WEB-INF/classes/config/index contains
"gsearch_solr".

Additionally, the directory "gsearch_solr/conf" contains the Solr configuration
files, which can/should be symlinked to from the solr.home directory (in many
installations, this ends up being something like
/usr/local/fedora/gsearch_solr/solr (alongside the "data" directory)).
